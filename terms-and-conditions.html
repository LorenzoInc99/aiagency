Notwithstanding the foregoing, all knowledge that our tools, systems, or methods create or adapt from learning about your business and the Services provided to you may remain our property where applicable by law or agreement.</p>

      <h2>3. Autopilot Consulting's Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
      <p>You acknowledge that, as between you and us, we own all right, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to our intellectual property, which includes all source code, databases, functionality, software, website designs, audio, video, text, photographs and graphics on the Site (collectively, the "Content") and the trademarks, service marks and logos on the Site (the "Marks"), all of which are protected by copyright and trademark laws and various other intellectual property rights. You shall not use the Services or Site for any purposes beyond the scope of the access granted in these Terms and Conditions. You shall not at any time, directly or indirectly: (i) copy, modify, or create derivative works of the Services or Site, in whole or in part; (ii) rent, lease, lend, sell, license, sublicense, assign, distribute, publish, transfer, or otherwise make available the Services or Site; (iii) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, decode, adapt, or otherwise attempt to derive or gain access to any software component of the Services, in whole or in part; or (iv) remove any proprietary notices from the Services or Site.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>(1) all information you submit will be true, accurate, current and complete;</li>
        <li>(2) you will maintain the accuracy of such information and promptly update such information as necessary;</li>

      <h2>14. Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p><strong>Informal Negotiations.</strong> To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms and Conditions (each a "Dispute"), you and we agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration.
